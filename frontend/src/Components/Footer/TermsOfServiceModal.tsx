            These Legal Terms, along with any policies or rules posted on the Services, form the
            complete and final agreement between you and us. If we do not enforce any right or
            provision of these Legal Terms, it does not mean we waive it. We may assign our rights
            and obligations to others at any time. We are not liable for any loss, damage, delay, or
            failure caused by events outside of our control. If any provision of these Legal Terms
            is found to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision is severed, and the rest
            remain valid and enforceable. Using our Services does not create a joint venture,
            partnership, employment, or agency relationship between us. These Legal Terms will not
            be interpreted against us because we drafted them. You waive any defense based on the
            electronic nature of these Legal Terms or the lack of physical signatures.
